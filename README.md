# Parking Occupancy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks
**By:** Maria Isabel Arango Palacio, Isabella Montoya Henao, Jose Alejandro Villamizar, and María José Bernal Vélez


## Introduction
On average, people can spend up to seven minutes searching for a parking spot, especially in high-traffic urban areas, an inefficiency that contributes to congestion, stress, and wasted fuel. Traditional solutions to this problem often involve costly sensor-based systems installed in enclosed parking structures, limiting their scalability and practicality in open environments. 

To offer a more accessible and cost-effective alternative, this project proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect the occupancy status of individual parking spaces using images captured by cameras.
